Sandpile collapse simulation in C++

# Sandpile — Sandpile Collapse Simulation in C++

## 🌋 Overview

This project implements a cellular automaton to simulate the collapse of sandpiles on a 2D grid. Inspired by self-organized criticality (SOC), the model illustrates how simple local rules lead to complex, fractal-like global behavior through toppling (avalanches).

## ⚙️ Features

- Customizable 2D grid dimensions and initial height
- Automatic toppling of unstable cells (height ≥ 4)
- Full stabilization of the grid
- ASCII visualization of the current configuration
- Random grain addition with automatic stabilization
- Tracking of total topplings
- Overloaded `+` operator to combine configurations
